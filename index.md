### Software Development and Data Engineering

Welcome to my software development information page. I am an integrated data platforms and web systems designer with experience writing resilient APIs in various target industries.

I possess an innate understanding of data analysis, design patterns and process efficiencies. I enjoy new challenges and analytical paths to provide comprehensive and reliable software systems at any scale.

### Profile

I was born and raised in Maryland, and I currently live with my wife and infant child in Baltimore. I completed my bachelor's degree at the University of Maryland, College Park in biological sciences in 2015. I initially worked in the biotechnology sector before making the move over to being a software developer late in 2019. My scientific background gave me a leg up in technical problem solving and a strong ability to grasp complex technical systems.

My first software engineering role gave me rigorous experience with Java, building an enterprise level NLP system. I was also selected to a project to work with the machine learning team of the NLP platform, we created an integrated data analytics pipeline where I showcased my Python skills to create a critical connection between the TensorFlow cores and a web user interface.

My current role as a contractor with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has been a fusion of my background in biology and my current skillset in software development. In this role I have sharpened my programming skills primarily in Golang, Python, and Typescript. My background as a user of NCBI systems motivates my interest in innovation of bioinformatics as both a data engineering and web development project. You can find my work at [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets) where you can efficiently navigate virtually all known bioinformatics data - the front-end, service back-end, ETL data pipelines, and CLI tools are all parts of the project I have moved forward in significant ways.

Outside of work I am an avid outdoor person, I get out to hike, bike and camp with family and friends regularly. As well, I enjoy playing music on keyboard and expanding my vinyl record collection from music shops in Baltimore and beyond.

Thank you for visiting my info page, feel free to learn more about my personal take on computer science and software topics in my [Software Manifesto](/docs/manifesto.md). Please reach out to me with any questions, or feedback. My email and resume are linked below.
